## Particle Flow

These are the coding steps for my Particle Flow talk at Async Brighton (May 2024).

Start a webserver in the root directory and navigate to the given location in your browser.

For example:

```
cd particle-flow-talk
http-server --port 8125
```

Visit `localhost:8125`.

If `http-server` not installed use:

```
npm install --global http-server
```
